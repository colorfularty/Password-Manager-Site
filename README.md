# Password-Manager-Site
A program that launches a website allowing you to keep track of the passwords you use for various things.
This website will only be reachable on your local IP of 127.0.0.1:5000 when you run it.

# Prerequisites:

You must have Python installed on your machine to run this program. This program was created in Python version 3.11.3, and I cannot guarantee it will work on other versions of Python.
It will likely work on other versions of Python 3, but not Python 2.

You must have several external libraries installed for this program to work. To install this, make sure pip is intalled and simply type the following commands on the command line:

*pip install pyperclip*
*pip install flask*
*pip install flask-login*
*pip install -U Flask-SQLAlchemy*

This should install the libraries that the program uses.


# Running the program:

Download the .zip file from github and extract everything into a directory. To run the program, run the main.py file.
To do this from the command line, navigate to the directory in question and use the follow command:

*python main.py*

This should launch the program. Then navigate on a web browser to 127.0.0.1:5000 to access the site.


# Disclaimer:

I accept no responsibility for loss of any passwords for using this program. I strongly recommend you keep backups of your passwords for the worst case scenario.

**Make sure you write down the password you create for this program!**

If you forget your password, there is no recovering it, which means any stored passwords in this program will become inaccessible. Be careful!
